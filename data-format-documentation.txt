All experiments are stored in .h5 files.
- denotes a group
# denotes a dataset


- config: Experiment Configuration
	- attackboard: Configuration of the attack control board
		# build: Build-Timestamp of the attack control board firmware
		# uniqueId: "Unique ID" of the STM32F0 microcontroller on the attack control board
	# baud: baud rate for communication
	# cleanClosed: 1 if all data has been written and the file has been closed correctly
	# cooldown: (additional) pause between experiments in seconds
	- dut: Configuration of the DuT
		# build: Build-Timestamp of the DuT firmware
		# experiment: Experiment running on the DuT
		# uniqueId: "Unique ID" of the STM32F0 microcontroller on the DuT
	# evaluated: 1 if the file contains evaluated data in the "eval" group
	# serial: Serial port used in communication

- eval: Summarized evalation data
	# faultList: Experiment IDs (format: %05i) of successfull fault injections

- experiment: Experiment data, including input and output data
	- (Multiple Experiment IDs in %05i format): Experiment ID/experiment run for a single LFI attack execution.
		- env: Environmental data of the DuT, included for debugging purposes
			# temp: raw temperature data (to be ignored)
			# vref: raw supply voltage data (to be ignored)
		- eval: Evaluation of the experiment
			# faultindex: Faulted transaction in DMA experiment, unused for AES
			# faults: Number of detected faults in the experiment. 0 if not fault was observed.
		- result (for AES experiment): Input and Output data of the AES experiment
			# aesCiphertext: AES data/ciphertext output. This data contains the fault!
			# aesKey: AES key input
			# aesPlaintext: AES data/plaintext input
		- result (for DMA experiment): Input and output data of the DMA experiment
			# dma: data copied from flash memory to SRAM by the DMA. This data contains the faults!
			# inPattern: original data-word which is read from flash memory by the DMA
		- trigger: Low-Level trigger-time control. Trigger-time = value * 20.8ns.
			# Q: Laser Q-Switch trigger
			# algo: DuT algorithm trigger
			# laser: Laser Flash Lamp trigger
			# scope: Oscilloscope trigger (to be ignored)
